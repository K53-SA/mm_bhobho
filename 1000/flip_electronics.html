<div class="story">
<p>Meet Thandi, a young and ambitious girl with a dream to earn her own income while still in college. With only R1,000 in her pocket, she decided to take a leap into the world of electronics reselling. After researching the market, she discovered that she could buy authentic iPhones from suppliers in China at a much cheaper price than retail stores in South Africa. Her plan was simple yet bold: purchase a small batch, sell to her friends and colleagues, and gradually scale her business.</p>

<p>Thandi’s first challenge was convincing her customers to trust her. She made sure to explain clearly that the phones were genuine and affordable because she was importing them directly. She also informed her first buyers that there would be a waiting period of about one week for the phones to arrive, as they were shipped from overseas. To her surprise, her friends and colleagues were excited about the opportunity to get brand-new iPhones at lower prices and placed their orders without hesitation.</p>

<p>During the week-long wait, Thandi kept her customers updated about the shipment status, building trust and excitement. When the phones finally arrived, she carefully checked each device for quality assurance before delivering them personally. The joy and gratitude on her customers’ faces made her realize that her effort and dedication were paying off, and her reputation as a reliable reseller began to grow rapidly.</p>

<p>Word spread quickly, and more people wanted to buy iPhones through Thandi. She used her initial profits to reinvest in larger batches, increasing her stock while keeping her pricing attractive. In just a month, Thandi managed to turn her initial R1,000 investment into a whopping R20,000 in profit. Her success was not just about the money; it was about her learning how to negotiate with suppliers, manage her finances, and maintain excellent customer service.</p>
