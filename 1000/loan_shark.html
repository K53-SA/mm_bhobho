<p>Thabo, a young entrepreneur, decided to start a small informal loan service among his circle of friends and family. With only R1,000, he offered daily microloans at small interest rates to help those who needed immediate cash. He made sure to track every loan carefully and maintained trust by being transparent with the terms.</p>

<p>His approach was professional and ethical; he only lent small amounts and reminded borrowers of repayment dates. Slowly, he built a reputation for being reliable and fair. People started trusting him, knowing that he would treat them respectfully while managing the loans responsibly.</p>

<p>Within a month, Thabo turned his initial R1,000 into over R10,000 in profit through careful lending and daily interest collection. He reinvested the profits to expand his services and even started offering small financial advice to his clients. Thabo’s story illustrates how small-scale lending, when done responsibly, can provide both financial growth and a learning opportunity in money management.</p>
