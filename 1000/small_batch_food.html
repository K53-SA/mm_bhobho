<p>Lerato, a 22-year-old foodie, wanted to start a small business with minimal investment. With only R1,000, she decided to make small batches of gourmet snacks, such as flavored popcorn, cookies, and homemade jams. She carefully selected high-quality ingredients and focused on creating unique flavors that would attract local customers and friends.</p>

<p>She started promoting her products through social media and word of mouth, taking orders in advance. Customers were excited to try her small batch foods and were willing to wait a few days for fresh deliveries. Lerato used simple packaging but ensured everything looked appealing and professional, building trust and excitement around her brand.</p>
