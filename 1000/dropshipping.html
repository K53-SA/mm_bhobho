<div class="story">
<p>Thando, a 20-year-old student, wanted to start a business without holding inventory. With just R1,000, he discovered dropshipping, a method where he could sell products online while suppliers handled stock and shipping. He set up a small online store and selected trending products from suppliers overseas that could be sold to friends, family, and online communities.</p>

<p>He focused on marketing through social media, creating engaging posts, and reaching out to local buyers who were interested in unique gadgets and accessories. Customers placed orders on his website, and Thando forwarded these to his suppliers. Within a week, the first products were delivered to eager buyers. Despite waiting a few days, the buyers were satisfied because Thando maintained constant communication and updates about their orders.</p>

<p>Within 30 days, Thando turned his initial R1,000 investment into over R10,000 in profits by reinvesting wisely and scaling his marketing efforts. His story shows that with the right strategy, dropshipping can be a low-risk method to start a business, gain entrepreneurial experience, and generate significant revenue, even with a small budget. Thando’s perseverance, communication skills, and smart selection of products were key to his success.</p>
