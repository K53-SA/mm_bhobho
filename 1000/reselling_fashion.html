<p>Thandi, a 21-year-old student, realized she could turn a small budget into profit by reselling fashion items. With just R1,000, she purchased trendy clothing and accessories from wholesale markets, carefully selecting items that were in demand among her peers. Her goal was to provide affordable yet stylish options while building a small business around her personal brand.</p>

<p>She started by posting her items on social media platforms and local online marketplaces, showcasing high-quality photos and engaging descriptions. Orders started trickling in, and although customers had to wait a few days for delivery, the excitement and anticipation built trust and loyalty. Thandi reinvested her profits into buying more popular items and expanding her inventory strategically.</p>
