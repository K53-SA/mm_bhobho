<div class="story">
<p>Lerato, a young entrepreneur, saw a gap in her city for easy access to event tickets. Many popular concerts and festivals would sell out quickly, leaving fans frustrated. With just R1,000, she decided to start an event ticket reselling business. She would buy tickets early and sell them at competitive prices to friends, colleagues, and local fans who wanted guaranteed entry.</p>

<p>Her first challenge was gaining trust. She created a simple website and a WhatsApp group to update customers about upcoming events and ticket availability. Customers had to wait a short period before receiving their tickets, but the anticipation built excitement and reliability around her service. Lerato handled every order personally, ensuring tickets were delivered securely and on time, which helped her build a solid reputation quickly.</p>

<p>Within the first month, Lerato’s R1,000 investment grew to over R6,000. She reinvested her profits into more tickets and even partnered with event organizers for early access. Her dedication to excellent customer service and timely delivery kept her clients coming back and referring friends. This success story demonstrates that with observation, planning, and persistence, even a small initial investment can grow significantly, while also providing a valuable service to the community.</p>
